### Vue style guide notes:

-   Presentational components begin with V prefix: VButton

-   Components that should only ever have a single active instance should begin with the The prefix, to denote that there can be only one.

-   Child components that are tightly coupled with their parent should include the parent component name as a prefix.

-   Component names should start with the highest-level (often most general) words and end with descriptive modifying words.

-   Prop names should always use camelCase during declaration, but kebab-case in templates and JSX.

-   Directive shorthands (: for v-bind:, @ for v-on: and # for v-slot) should be used always or never.
